## Team Description

The **P3tsKit** app is developed by a dedicated team aiming to assist pet owners in quickly identifying wounds and providing essential first aid instructions. The app’s main feature is an AI-powered wound detection and classification system that processes images captured by the user’s smartphone camera. Depending on the type of wound detected, the app offers detailed information about the condition and suggests immediate first aid actions to help care for the pet.
